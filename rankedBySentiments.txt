0.3198, 0123ff48e49048d40b, Zhiyan D., Programming is a joy to me. I've worked on a lot of projects based on PHP, Mysql, HTML, CSS, Javascript. And I enjoyed the process of solving clients' problems.  I'm now running a web development studio with my best friend Fancy. Fancy and I are the only members of the studio. Because we believe the number of people is not the most important factor to decent work. Instead, sometimes you get worse outcomes when there're too many people. So, we figured the 2 of us is enough and it turned out that we're correct. :)  I'm a full time freelancer, and I pretty much enjoy such a life.   Now I teach a web development course in my college every year, which I believe is helpful to those college students who're interested in web development. I enjoy it when my students tell me they've gained a lot from the course.

0.3038, 01753f7c3c9c2de32f, Samantha Bruandet, Dear Friend-  My name is Samantha- but you can call me Sam.   I am very excited to be here, and the fact that you are reading this makes me even happier, because it means that you are interested in working with me.   So, what shall I say to introduce myself and make you pick me?  Well, of course I could say that I am an experienced copywriter, always motivated, very hard-working, and so on.  But, that's what everyone who wants to work with you will say.   I want to go deeper than that and tell you the real reason why I am here, the real reason why I love writing copy, and the reason why you really want to pick me.  My passion is to help companies write website content that converts. This means doing a lot of background research, not only on the product but also and most importantly on the market. Who is your target market?   Some of my best works include:  www.ayrawireless.com - A company that specializes in Wireless electronics. www.morphomfg.com - A contract manufacturer based out of China.   I also love to do coverage and sales letters and I only work with clients that have products that I love, or provide services that amaze me.   That should be your #1 priority.  Make sure the person you hire is really, I mean extremely enthusiastic about your product. If you hire someone who isn't, even if their credentials are top-notch, their work won't exude any passion. And your clients will feel that. Bottom line is: no passion, no conversion.   Here is an article I wrote on behalf of MorphoMFG for CrowdCrux.  http:\/\/www.crowdcrux.com\/biggest-mistakes-when-manufacturing-crowdfunded-products-in-china\/   The article pulled in 20+ clients for MorphoMFG which was quite a BIG success since MorphoMFG makes an average of $10k per client.  I will be glad to provide you with a referral if you wish.  Looking forward to working with you!  To Our Shared Success,  Sam

I am able to apply diverse teaching techniques based on preferred learning styles. Many of my students passed HSK4 and HSK5 with high scores.  Aside from teaching Chinese, I also work as an English tour guide, interpreter, Chinese painting teacher and Chinese calligraphy teacher.  Please feel free to contact me if you need any of the above service.  MORE ABOUT BECKY  1. What do I offer?  I offer all kinds of Mandarin courses, Business Mandarin, Cross-cultural Mandarin\uff0cHSK Exam preparation, Survival Chinese or Comprehensive Mandarin on Skype   2. Why do I want to teach Mandarin?  I\u2019ve always been very curious about different cultures. I worked for international business companies, like global sources, so I was exposed to the western culture a lot. Teaching Mandarin allows me to get to know more about people from the west and their cultures. Besides teaching the language, I like to discuss cultural differences and share with my students the Chinese way of thinking, the arts, the mindsets and etc. in my class. Helping westerners to become better at Mandarin and understand the Chinese culture gives me a sense of great satisfaction.   3. What makes I a different Mandarin teacher?  I am very interested in cultures and psychology. I always first try to understand my students\u2019 background, personality, their ways of thinking and learning habits before teaching them anything. Chinese people like to learn things by heart mostly. Most westerners like to understand things first and also use their imagination to help learning. People with degrees in science like to use formulas while arts students tend to use images and their imagination more. Finding the best way to help students learn is the key to be a good Mandarin teacher and I think I am good at it.   4. How many students have I taught?  About 150. I teach mostly one-on-one courses. Most of my students are from Europe, North America and Australia. I think my students are my teachers. I\u2019ve learnt a great deal from them. I also had some quite interesting experiences with my students. Last summer, I accompanied a student from Canada, who is a businessman, on a business trip to GZ and Shenzhen. Before the trip, I put together some practical materials about business Mandarin and gave him intense training on business conversation skills and talked about Chinese business culture.

I\u2019m good at developing performance testing script base on C language in web system, and also have good skills in develop QTP script.\r \u3000\u3000As we all know that software performance has become more and more important, while thousands of the users log in the system or visit the website simultaneously, the problem may occurred, the system crash or the server deny to provide the service to the user, so the performance testing need to be done before the software delivered to our customers.\r \u3000\u3000We also benefit from the automation testing. There is always a lot of function testing or regression testing need us to finish in a short time. But we do not have enough time and sufficient human resource to complete it, how should we do? So the automation testing is the best solution. It cut down the costs, improve the work efficiency, save our time and energy. Its advantage is not merely as so.

Advanced user of both Ableton Live 7 through 9 and Pro Tools 10 through 12 and proficient in every aspect and stage of a music production from pre-production to post-production. A workhorse with strong comprehension of a multitude of genres and sub genres of music and experience to back it up with.  For the last 4 years I've worked at a Beijing based production company mainly composing scores for TVC's and TV\/internet features. Since a year ago I opened my own studio and now work freelance.  Besides TV and features I've done several album and EP productions mainly for Asian artists and bands.  When I started out I rarely had budgets to hire mixing and mastering engineers so even though I wouldn't call myself a mixing nor mastering engineer, it's something I'm quite accomplished at and I have continued to mix and master my own projects whenever needed.  I do sound design, but I would not call myself an expert on this type of production.  I'm currently interested in doing more work with HRTF audio for VR experiences and games, but again it's a field where I have very little practical experience, so my price takes this fact into consideration.

0.2064, 013ea1d320025e76a3, Christophe Mutabazi, Hi, my name is Chris! I am a software developer with 3 years experience. I have worked in different fields but mostly the web field and mobile. I love writing beautiful code that matters, and i am excited about how technology is changing people's lives. I am constantly figuring out what tools i can build to solve the problems i face in my daily life or even the people around me. I have been working as a freelancer most of my time but i also once worked in a startup, which puts me in a good position to be confident enough that i will build great products for my customers.   I have worked with different languages which are PHP, Javascript, Python and Ruby. I believe that each technology has it's abilities depending on the project thus the language i use for a specific project depends on the project it's self and the capabilities that a certain language offers me in terms of development. My self I love PHP and i have spent most of my time there so far. But since coding is my life i have different other projects with other different technologies.  I believe that talent is not all when it comes to business thus i also work hard and put in much efforts in whatever project i am working on. If you are looking for hard work and passion i am definitely the right guy for you.  I will be glad to work with you!

I worked for several oversea companies (Newegg, ACTIVE Network) as a full-time employee and mastered many related engineering best practices.  FRONT-END BACKGROUND  I can build everything web tech related, be it a static fixed layout website, responsive website, dynamic web app or mobile hybrid app, using the latest advances in the field. But mostly, I'm focused on the following techs: ES2015, React, Redux, Immutable, Gulp, LESS, Git. I'm also proficient with Responsive Web Design so your website\/app will look good no matter the device users use.  I'm also very aware of WPO (Web Performance Optimization) and can make it happen.

MOBILE BACKGROUND  I used to write native iOS and Android applications back in Newegg, but I prefer to write mobile hybrid applications with web technologies now. I can write mobile hybrid applications with PhoneGap\/Cordova and make use of several mobile UI frameworks (Framework7 being my personal favorite).  OTHER  I like to make promises I can keep, because I'm accountable for my work.

As a romantically critical individual, I have demonstrated exceptional writing and translating skills especially with art essays and critiques. My exquisite taste also gathers accolades from peers who cherishes curatorship. With an artistic upbringing \u2013-14 years of classical music training, ballet lessons and a hopeless adoration for visual culture-\u2013 I have been a contributor in the world of arts since obtaining my MA from KU Leuven.  Originally from Taiwan, I have lived, studied and worked in the USA, the Netherlands and Belgium. My experiences in different continents have sculptured me into a culturally sensitive wanderer tirelessly pushing myself to explore, perceive and cogitate on contemporary art and urban life. And very spontaneously (yet carefully,) I infuse those intricate thoughts into my writings.  I have also recorded vocals for a bilingual mobile application, and have anchored numerous events, from international academic conferences to game show, WorldMUN sessions to movie premier\/seminar.  My current location, Shanghai, means I am able to provide premium content at a relatively lower rate. I have had professors, executives and officials come back to me time after time for more collaborations, and am confident that you will become one of them once our partnership embarks.  :)

I have translated from English to Chinese for a famous website Nobilified.com, many parts of the Ayana Resort and Spa Bali\u2019s official website, a few episodes of a famous travel TV show \u201cBare Feet\u201d and so on.  I grew up in a bilingual environment since my dad is an English Professor. I went to High school in the United States in upstate New York where I home-stayed with a family of six and learned a lot about American English, culture and family. I then got my Bachelor Degree in English and Chinese Translation and Interpreting from one of the top universities in China, during which I had a whole systematic training of translation and interpreting. After that I worked as an Office Administrator in an international NGO in Beijing where I did a lot of business related translation.   Last year I graduated with degree in Event Management from Swiss Hotel Management School. And most recently I worked at one of the biggest resorts in Bali as a Mandarin Guest Relations Officer. My main task was to interpret for Chinese guests and to assist them with all the check-in, check-out process and other esquires.   I specialize in tourism translation, CV or resume translation, TV translation, contract translation, magazine article translation, menu translation, conference translation and so on.

0.1754, 014878f2459e3a4cb9, Zha Agabe-Granfar, Check out my linkedin profile for details on my experience and endorsements (https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/zhaagabegranfar).  Basically, if you're looking for someone reliable, highly experienced and has demonstrated a clear understanding of being in your shoes as a business owner\/manager\/founder - then look no further.  I'm an Australian living abroad as an expat, and since having my first baby in December 2014 I've opted to setup a more flexible work arrangement so I can keep my mind professionally active parallel to being a mum.  Operating and owning an SME can be a challenge on many fronts.  It's hard to fathom unless you've done it yourself.  And when you're in and amongst the grind of building your enterprise - it's helpful to have an unbiased soundboard or 'co-thinker' who can help to organise your cluster of ideas into solid steps so that you and your business can benefit.  Leaders for large businesses and multinationals have the benefit (and budget!) of expert strategic advisors or directors in key business functions:  marketing, sales, finance, legal, operations etc.  For SMEs, it all comes down to the owner\/founder.  Some things I'd enjoy and may be able to assist you\/your business with:  - Refining your business's 'elevator pitch'  - Professional Powerpoint (PPT) Presentations of your business:  Sales; Company Profiles; Product Trainings etc. - Identifying KPIs relevant to your business - Financial Planning and Budgeting - Creating a Targeted Marketing Campaign - Sound boarding your ideas and in an unbiased manner - help to identify holes or overlooked opportunities - Competitive Analyses - Executive Summaries  - Risk Management (usually for more established businesses)

I'm used to friending with books and diving deeply in the pages for hours, I always think reading can help me find real peace and expand my mind, and I would never feel alone with those speechless friends. In addition, I love classic movies very much, and sometimes I would take the movie and the original book together so that I could understand much more. As for me, books and movies are two important horcruxes in my life. I've hidden fragments of my soul in them. Then even if my body is attacked or destroyed, for part of the soul remains earthbound and undamaged.  In terms of English study, I've learnt it for more than seven years, and I have couples of foreigner friends around the world. By communicating with them, my English got improved a lot. Besides, three months ago, a Swedish friend recommended me to do some text translation for two Swedish game companies. It was an amazing experience, and they all satisfied with my work. In addition, because of the passion for literature and English, recently I'm writing a novel named After Sunrise in English. I'm very excited about it. I've finished two chapters by now and I'll definitely stick with it.

It is in many respects similar to many other thermal-hydraulic codes but already from the very beginning the aim was to develop the multipurpose code. Even if the APROS is capable to simulate the reactor thermal hydraulics it can be applied to many other processes because it includes also many other program packages than thermal hydraulics. Models for the automation system, the electrical system and for different plant components enable the simulation of whole power plants

0.1611, 0191db72012cfe7e8c, Don Zaragoza,    I have been in music industry for more than 20 years. I started performing and teaching music since I was 18. From my 6 years experience in teaching guitar and theory I have encountered problems that new learners are struggling with due to traditional way of learning music. This started a whole new journey of my life to make new approaches in learning, creating and understanding music. After more than 15 years of performing music, I finally met another interesting part of my life dealing with children and their brain development. This opened up another important part of music that many are now disregarding in their everyday experiences. The importance of music in brain development and its power to connect to our past and to our inner selves. With my wide musical background I started creating ways how to incorporate music to brain development, create programs for developmentally  delayed children to rewire brain functioning using music and started understanding people and solving the reasons why they didn't grow with music at all. Through performances, written works and shared concepts I was able to grow more and understand what people need when it comes to topics regarding music. It became easier to interact with people that I didn't know at first when we start discussing topics related to music and eventually build their musical interest and hidden musical inclination.

0.1517, 015243a1f7c281220f, Suyang Guo, I am Sue Young, an upcoming freelance English-Chinese translator. Due to my unique upbringing, I am a native Chinese speaker with a near-native level of English skills. If you are new to the world of freelance, worry not: I am easy to contact, willing to communicate and always happy to get feedbacks from my client. If you are a regular user of Upwork, that is also great: I have all the standard skills, then maybe a few more.   In 2014, I graduated from Washington University in St. Louis with a B.A. in Biochemistry, a minor in communication design and a cluster in English writing. Before that, I graduated valedictorian from a prestigious bilingual boarding school in China.  As a proof of my English proficiency, I scored an 119 (out of 120) on TOFEL and a 780 (out of 800) on SAT verbal reasoning upon graduating high school, surpassing more than 99% of my peers. Last year, I scored 166 (out of 170) on GRE verbal reasoning, demonstrating mastery of graduate level English. In addition to that, I am a native Mandarin speaker from northern China. I was a writer then editor of the school newspaper, a member of the debate team, and a campus speech writer during my high school years. My experience in biochemistry means I am familiar with scientific materials. My minor in communication design polished my skills with Adobe products (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign). I am also highly efficient with office Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint). Since my graduation two years ago, I have been working in an English-speaking academic environment. I have also translated more than 10,000 words of English fiction into Chinese for a private project. Moreover, between high school and college, I worked as a course organizer at a prep school, facilitating the communication between the English-speaking faculty and Chinese staff.  For my service, I offer 100% human translation: always well researched and double-checked by another native speaker for the best possible quality. Please don not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions, or set up an interview so we can start the project right away!

My knowlages and work experiance are most of all things I tried to share for people. Every day I'm doing my best to improve seo abilities and Chinese language. English-Russian translation is my hobby, that's gives me more than fun, and also ability to start comunicate with growing freelance comunity. Feel free to contact =)

Yet, after having secured my MFA in Creative Writing, I have spent the last five years extending my writing experience to include a memoir (that was picked up by a literary agent immediately and will hopefully be published in 2017), professional blogging on various websites, education writing for English-language lessons and scripts, and continued work with professional print magazines as a monthly columnist in Beijing (China) and for publications throughout North America.   I am a native English speaker while also being fluent in Mandarin Chinese and French. I am best suited to translate directly into my native language from Mandarin or French, but can also conduct translations into my secondary languages. I am most thrilled to translate within the creative sector and have excelled as such jobs as song lyric translation and professional artist bio translations. Currently, most of my translation experience is in the field of personal correspondence for individual clients (emails, letters, etc.) or in the realm of educational materials creation.

0.1447, 016f36b80762e6b754, Nathalie Verhaeghe, Hi,  My name is Nathalie and I am a native English speaker from South Africa. I have been teaching English since 2009, where I began my teaching career at a language training centre in Pretoria. I had the good fortune of working with learners from all over the globe and in 2012, I made the bold move of coming to one of China's largest cities, Tianjin, to teach English to children, though I have just recently switched positions from teacher to learner once again and am currently doing a BA in Chinese Language and Literature.   During my time as an English teacher I have undertaken a vast amount of proofreading projects, mainly for Chinese learners studying in universities in the area doing research projects and theses, though I have also proofread and edited collections of short stories. The largest proofreading project I have undertaken to date was an in-depth guide to identification of the birds of Southern Africa, which will surely come in handy when I find myself under my African skies again.  There is a great sense of satisfaction I take from completing such projects as it so often can mean the difference between success and failure for learners who, although may have great knowledge and passion for their fields, lack the language ability to adequately express themselves in English. I have a great understanding of the language structures of different languages and the inhibitions they incur when one is faced with the challenge of translating to English without losing meaning or tone.   When I'm not studying or teaching, I'm most likely to be found on a plane, a train, a cranky 1970's converted motorhome or at the back of a passer-by's pickup truck headed somewhere interesting. I take traveling very seriously, and usually end up seriously lost. I spend as little time planning and as much time as possible out among the trees and flowers. I'm a great lover of nature and can easily get lost in a tiny landscape between the rocks or grass for hours to capture the beauty of the miniature world we so often forget to look at as we go about our day-to-day lives.   Should you need a travel writer or a proofreader to knit-pick your grammar and punctuation, don't hesitate to contact me.   Wishing you sunshine.

I am pursuing the Master degree and I will graduate in July 2018. After getting insight into the UN interns, I am impressed by the culture of UN and the opportunity you offer. The following is my background information.  I have completed an internship in the MARS Information Service China during November 2014 to July 2015. In this 8-month internship, I engaged in different tasks which were closely related to information security, including weekly global risk reporting and SEP client trouble shooting. I was staffed on a range of tasks from designing Excel VBA programs, script coding, programs debugging, to run related reports with the programs. I am trained and equipped with necessary knowledge and skills to become a data processor and information security analyst.  After the internship, my skills in Excel re-development impressed my leader a lot. Moreover, I was even recommended to other departments. I gradually became a vendor for them. I have developed several programs to automate their periodical reports, greatly enhanced their working efficiency. During the cooperation with colleagues from other countries, I found working in a diverse employee base very interesting and inspiring. I had performed well as a vendor and earned admiration from several senior managers.  Furthermore, I have joined various student organizations, such as class committee and Secretary Department of the Student Union. Through these student affairs experiences, I have not only developed my leadership, teamwork and communication skills, but also the mindset of running an organization efficiently.  Although I am not major in information technology, I have developed a special interest in information management after the internship. And I got proficient in Excel re-development and office automatization. As a layman of information technology, I can still quickly learn the relevant knowledge and finish the task with a high evaluation. Of course I can skillfully master the software required by my major, such as AutoCAD, SolidWorks, UG, Moldflow and so on. My skills in learning new technology will help me to be qualified of all new kinds of work.

They do not get excited about the project and they surely do not try to see what you see. By the end of the project you are not getting what you were thinking and you are not happy with the project. You have to give up your money and just accept what you got.  I do not do things that way. I will include you in the entire process of design and development. You will be with me every step of the way to ensure you are getting what you want. Think of me as a professional sketch artist, I create what you see. If you do not have the time or energy to be involved in the process, that is okay because I will ask you the right questions. In the end, you will get what you see now and you will be happy about it. Plus, you will save some money! Everyone loves that.

Originally begun as a Relocation & Business Consulting service for ex-pats new to China, the company has expanded into Online Sales and Exports, Telecommunications, Media and Virtual Assistants.       We have done business with professionals in many fields, Chinese government and military projects, and large companies like T-Mobile, S.F. Express, Shenzhen Daily, Sears, the Canadian and American Diabetes Associations.   Jolene\u2019s skill set is extremely valuable as a Virtual Assistant.  She has worked in museums, customer service, and education, but now focuses on event planning and consulting.  The following is a summary of her work in these fields.         She learned and perfected many transferable skills from four years working in museums.  She completed research for exhibits at Discovery House Museum and Lambton Heritage Museum in 1999 and 2000, respectively. The Canadian Military Heritage Museum had no way to track their artifacts in 2002 and as such had lost a high percentage of their collection.  Jolene created a cataloguing database, which included detailed descriptions of their artifacts, history, location, and which members had access.  This maintained their collection, eased planning for future exhibits, and increased donations.    Her customer service positions were in telecommunications and electronics.  She completed orders and provided customer support and technical help, while working at Canadian and American mobile companies.  She became conversant in technical support for smart phones over the phone and by e-mail.  Jolene wrote the training manual for one outsourcer in 2007.  She worked for 10 years as an English Teacher\/Trainer in China, Britain, Canada and South Korea.  She had positions in many institutions, such as a university, newspaper and public school, as well as training centers and kindergartens.  Her duties centered on Curriculum Development, Marketing and Management.  She excelled at researching topics to prepare Chinese students for university abroad, and creating interactive Power Point Presentations.  She planned an end of term pageant for FunTime English Center in 2010, which increased enrollment.  Jolene worked with all grade levels to prepare performances, and presented a workshop, with accompanying pamphlet, for parents wishing to improve their children\u2019s English.  This involved a lot of writing, logistics, and scheduling.             Jolene\u2019s experience in event planning and consulting often overlap as both involve marketing to improve businesses profits.  She handles customer files, does blogs and marketing writing, and keeps detailed records of expenses, venues and suppliers.  Every job has different requirements, but she is able to quickly formulate and implement plans using her databases.    Through The Source Vixens, Jolene has access to other team member\u2019s proficiencies in web development, programming, VOIP and sales.

0.1170, 01a7a3a59cec36686b, Xujing Wang, After graduating from University of International Business and Economics as an English Translation Postgraduate in July 2007, I joined a reputable transaction company and became a full-time translator in the financial sector.  The expatriation at the United Nations Office at Vienna stands out in my nine years\u2019 work-life. Based on my good performance and development potential, my company sent me to the Chinese Section of UNOV as a Temporary Appointment Translator for nine months in November 2010. When I left there, the Section Chief commented that I had \u201cdemonstrated the competencies required for a staff member and provided satisfactory service to the Section. Ms. Wang successfully meets performance expectations.\u201d  1.\tCo-translated the Industrial Development Report 2010 of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization;  2.\tCo-translated the World Drug Report 2010 of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime; 3.\tCo-translated the documents relating to the Twentieth Session of the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice;  4.\tCo-translated the documents relating to the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption; and 5.\tCo-translated the routine documents of UN organizations including the Office for Outer Space Affairs, the International Narcotics Control Board, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization and the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law.

My above translations have been published on the websites of relevant organizations as official documents or become the references for the Chinese delegations to attend various meetings.  The financial translation field is always my main battlefield. Below lists my main work:  I was entrusted by the People\u2019s Bank of China to proofread Chinese translations of serial international economic and financial situation research reports written by the International Monetary Fund and responsible for the sections on fiscal, nonconventional monetary and macroeconomic aspects; I translated and proofread Bank of China Annual Report 2009, Annual Report 2011 and Annual Report 2013 (including the sections on Message from the Chairman, Overview, Report of the Board of Directors and Risks); I translated and proofread Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Annual Report 2009, Annual Report 2010 and Annual Report 2013 (including the sections on Message from the Chairman, Overview, Report of the Board of Directors and Risks); I translated the whole texts of Hua Xia Bank Annual Report 2012 and Annual Report 2013 (except the \u201cReport of the Board of Directors\u201d, for which I was a proofreader) and the Auditor\u2019s Reports; I translated the whole texts of Hankou Bank Annual Report 2012 and Annual Report 2013 (except the \u201cReport of the Board of Directors\u201d, for which I was a proofreader); I translated and proofread some sections of Bohai Bank Annual Report 2013 and independently translated all of its appendices (including the financial statements, the Self-assessment Report on Internal Control, the Auditor\u2019s Statement and the Special Report on Related Party Transactions); my tasks throughout the years include translating and proofreading correspondences, meeting documents, reports, articles of association and policies of the shareholders\u2019 general meeting, the board of directors, the special committees of the board of directors and the board of supervisors of Bank of China, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank and CITIC Bank, documents of the Shareholders\u2019 Meeting of China Asset Management Co., Ltd. and its fund research reports, performance reports, articles of association and policies, as well as gazettes of the Ministry of Finance, PRC and letters of guarantee of Bank of Communications.

0.1001, 019df803cc136b9900, Wu Lei, Analysis of data is a process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, suggesting conclusions, and supporting decision-making. Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under a variety of names, in different business, science, and social science domains.\r \r Data mining is a particular data analysis technique that focuses on modeling and knowledge discovery for predictive rather than purely descriptive purposes. Business intelligence covers data analysis that relies heavily on aggregation, focusing on business information. In statistical applications, some people divide data analysis into descriptive statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and confirmatory data analysis (CDA). EDA focuses on discovering new features in the data and CDA on confirming or falsifying existing hypotheses. Predictive analytics focuses on application of statistical models for predictive forecasting or classification, while text analytics applies statistical, linguistic, and structural techniques to extract and classify information from textual sources, a species of unstructured data. All are varieties of data analysis.

Thanks also go to Henry N. Ong, the CEO and chief instructor of Inventive Media. His computer major in De La Salle University has established his pioneer position as a professional lecturer and coach for CMS website development courses as early as 1997. His talent is also shown on his extensive brand training courses, such as, CCTV, Photoshop, Joomla and WordPress. I am very impressive not only to his great talent in detailed teaching but also to his passion. He is the lecturer who sometimes forgets the dismissing time of the seminars, leading to several hours\u2019 delay until to ten o\u2019clock in late evening.

0.0963, 013ab3e6806d196765, Tess Humphrys, I understand that bad English copy or translations can undermine your business' professionalism and image, especially if you have global aspirations. Let me help you make sure your clients\/customers\/users are not focused on bad English when they read your materials.  I have a BA in journalism and 10 years' experience working in communications roles where my writing skills have mattered and have consistently gained praise from managers and clients. I write engaging, SEO-friendly copy for websites, craft compelling news releases and feature pieces that tell stories, and proofread and sub-edit documents to rogue comma accuracy, at the same time ensuring their meaning is crystal clear with as much impact as possible.   For the past three years I have lived and worked in China where I have built up extensive experience of polishing and editing 'Chinglish', ensuring that texts that have been translated from Chinese to English by non-native speakers sound natural yet impactful in English. Chinese and English are extremely different languages and too often inexperienced, non-native translators lack the level of understanding of English to ensure their work sounds authentic. Let me help you make sure that the work that comes in from translators is fit for purpose.   I am fluent in Spanish and can apply my writing and editing skills to translating texts from Spanish to English, crafting a parallel copy in English targeting native English-speaking audiences.  I have created copy for web pages, online ads, promotional emails, white papers, brochures, videos, press releases, internal magazines, etc. I am experienced in writing compelling and appropriate content for blogs, tweets, and Facebook and LinkedIn posts.   Having trained as a journalist and worked in a number of roles in busy marketing and communications offices, deadlines are sacred to me. I will work with you to determine realistic and achievable timelines for work.
0.0962, 018d2585238f144d32, Michael H., Professionally, I am an English Teacher at Sanya University with experience editing papers for publication. Because many of the publications are intended for international conferences (my last conference was the International Conference on Art, Design, and Contemporary Education), I am capable of editing papers that are roughly translated from Russian and Chinese and wrought with errors, essentially streamlining broken English to fluency without changing the author's intended meaning. If I can craft a published paper from a jumble of Chinese thrown into a translator, I am sure I can manage whatever task you have.   Outside of academia, I have written poetry, travel essays, short stories, and short plays. I owe most of my ability to being well-read and having taken eclectic writing courses at Tufts University as an undergraduate.   Whether you need a thorough, academic proof-reading or the addition of some creative content, I am a flexible writer who is willing to work with you to achieve whatever goals you have.

Translators who learnt their second-language later on in life miss out on the subtleties inherent to each cultural worldview.  I grew up in the trilingual melting pot of Malaysia, where English was remnant of a British colonial past, Malay a national language, and Chinese my mother tongue.   Let's work together to translate meaning in a deliberate, concise, and elegant manner.
